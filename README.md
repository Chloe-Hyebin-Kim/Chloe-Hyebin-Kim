## **About Me**
I have been preparing for a college entrance exam for piano while attending middle and high school. However, due to the cost, I had to quit in the second year of high school, and I experienced inferiority in the face of helpless situation. The university where I had been entered at the age of 20 is different from the university that currently attending. I spent my high school days with low self-esteem and no goals, and entered the Department of Early Childhood Education at a university in Seoul according to my grades. I participated in the 'Good Neighbors Hope Sharing Class' at the request of a senior who is on practical practice. I was just only a freshman, there wasn't much that could do for love-hungry children.
Just become a more modeladult, raising my hand without hesitation to cross at the crosswalk, eating all the side dishes that the applicant hates, and saying good morning to the child alone first. The children said to me their future dream is to become a teacher like me.

I received more love than the love I gave to my children. I dreamed of becoming a lawyer, hoping that there would be no children facing the alienation and helplessness I felt in adolescence. I started studying for the college entrance exam at a rather late age of 23, when my friends were salaryman. I wanted to go to an academy, but I also had to study alone in
the reading room because of the cost. As I hesitated for many practical reasons, I didn't have enough time because I started in May, less than six months before the CSAT.
I learned how to overcome anxiety with responsibility for my own decisions. The self-imposed responsibility made me to be honesty. that honesty presented me to humility to accept the result. Due to the deviation between subjects, I couldn't go to the department of political science at the university I wanted, but I was courageous to seek the lane of cross-support without being frustrated. However, unlike my colleagues who have dreamed of becoming an Architect since I was a student, I entered the school according to the score, so I wandered around in the first grade thinking about my career. I focus on the my strength of mathematical thinking and what I have now. I majored in multiple majors in global media, nicknamed the "Art part of IT College" that can make the most of this. If you can't cross the wall through a fierce examination life, it's a way to take a detour, and it's the best fruit to learn that it leads every moment to the best.

## **My Vision**
I want to succeed in the foreign software market by developing a user-centered 3D physical engine. In knowledge-based industries such as software, technology development is, among other things, a success or failure factor. However, because software is a field that is hard to survive except for the first place, most foreign companies with strong brand recognition are leading the market except for a few application software sectors. There is also a fatal weakness in the lack of consistency and systematicity in the research environment compared to other foreign companies. This can be addressed by experienced developers who have worked together for years through management. However, Korea is rich in programmers and engineers who code programs, but lacks architect specialists, which is pointed out as the main reason for the poor development environment.
I have also worked as a designer who simply used the physics engine as a means of expression (tool) and as a core developer at a software company that develops the physics engine for 3D simulation. As I played both the conflicting roles of planners and developers, I felt more keenly that the consistency and systematicity of the research environment should be maintained to a certain extent between different tasks. Therefore, I wants to be an architect-level developer who can plan and direct the overall process
